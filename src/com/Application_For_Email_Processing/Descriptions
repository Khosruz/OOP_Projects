Email Administration Application
This nearly 40-minute tutorial is a little more advanced than the previous yet still at a very basic level. It shows how to make a program that simplifies the process of creating new email accounts for a particular business. This begins to delve into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) which is the main use of Java.

Once completed, the program should do a few things:

• It should generate a new email based on the employee’s first name, last name, and department.
• Generate a random string for their password.
• Have set methods to change the password.
• Have get methods to display name, email, and mailbox capacity.
