Student Management System
This project, like the previous one on this list, is from the Master Skills YouTube channel. It’s also just a little bit longer, coming in at nearly 50 minutes. This project is slightly more advanced than the last one and also involves OOP.

Once completed, your program should do a few things:

• Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database.
• The user should be prompted to enter a name and year for each student.
• The student should have a unique 5-digit id, with the first being their grade level.
• The student should have several course options to choose from.
• Each course costs $600 to enroll.
• The student should be able to check their balance and pay tuition.
• The status of the student should show their name, id, courses, and balance.
